# Risk management report

In this project, I will make data-driven decisions to devise plans and practices for use by organizational staff as well as be presented to a board-level audience. Detailed planning and risk management paper will be completed and as a presentation to the executive level. 

## Procedures

First, you will specify a risk management framework (RMF) to manage cybersecurity risk and describe the resources needed to support this RMF and prepare an executive briefing on that topic. 

Then, you will perform some of the initial steps in a risk management effort by identifying, classifying and prioritizing organizational assets and the threats to those assets. 

Finally, you will prepare and deliver a justification for the adoption of the risk management program.

## Structures

### PART 1: CREATING THE REPORT OF INFORMATION ASSET INVENTORY AND PRIORITIZATION

#### Table 1: Listing all information assets 

Data Owner: the person accountable for the classification, protection, use, and quality of one or more data sets within an organization.  While the CIO may be the data custodian, he/she is most likely NOT the owner of non-IT data.

Type of Sensitive Data Options:

•	Customer Confidential (Conf) – any data retained by the organization that has been labeled as confidential – i.e. limited in its access, distribution and use.  Examples include executive meeting records; marketing and strategic plans not yet released; details of communications with and services provided to select client organizations; and company IT and InfoSec program details.

•	Electronic Patient Healthcare Information (ePHI) – any data retained by the organization that contains personal medical information, including that of employees and clients. Employee health coverage information in an HR file is not ePHI for our purposes – unless it included details on the coverage such as the account number, primary care physician, etc. Most HR records would only contain the name of the coverage (e.g. Blue Cross/Blue Shield HMO), but not the details.

•	Payment Card Information (PCI) – any data retained by the organization that contains payment card information such as debit/credit card numbers with expiration dates, users’ names, security codes and/or billing information.  

•	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) – any data retained by the organization that contains personally identifiable information that could be used to identify an individual (or steal their identity) including names with social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, addresses, phone numbers, family members.

•	Student Records (FERPA) – any data retained by the organization that contains academic information regarding an individual including names with student numbers, social security numbers, courses taken, grades assigned, academic integrity/misconduct issues, financial aid and/or other PII.

#### Table 2: Mapping each information asset with perspective weighted ranking

Create a weighted table analysis, as described in a previous lecture, to rank all information assets from Table 1. 

1.	Identify 4-5 criteria you will use to evaluate the assets identified earlier and assign weights to the criteria. Note the weights must sum to 1.0 (as in 100%).

2.	Evaluate each information asset against your criteria by assigning a value of 0 to 5 (with 5 being most critical) under each asset criterion. Use the following scale, to answer the question: “How important is this asset with regard to this criterion?”

  a.	5 - Critically important 
  
  b.	4 - Very important
  
  c.	3 - Important

  d.	2 - Somewhat important

  e.	1 - A little important
  
  f.	0 - Not important

3.	Perform the calculations to determine the totals. (each cell is multiplied by its criterion’s weight, then all products are summed into the total column).
 
4.	Finally sort the entire table on the Total column. When you’re finished, your number one asset (first on the list) should be the one with the largest total, and thus the highest importance.

### PART 2: THREATS TO INFORMATION ASSET INVENTORY AND PRIORITIZATION

#### Table 3: Listing all weighted ranking of Threats to Information Assets

Complete the weighted table analysis to rank all threat from most to least dangerous. 

1.	Identify 4-5 criteria you will use to evaluate the threats and assign weights to the criteria. Note the weights must sum to 1.0 (as in 100%).
	 
2.	Evaluate each threat against your criteria by assigning a value of 0 to 5 (with 5 being most dangerous) under each threat criterion. Use the following scale, to answer the question: “How dangerous is this threat with regard to this criterion?”

  a.	5 - Critically dangerous 

  b.	4 - Very dangerous

  c.	3 - Dangerous

  d.	2 - Somewhat dangerous

  e.	1 - A little dangerous

  f.	0 - Not dangerous

3.	Perform the calculations to determine the totals. (each cell is multiplied by its criterion’s weight, then all products are summed into the total column).

4.	Finally sort the entire table on the Total column. When you’re finished, your number one threat (first on the list) should be the one with the largest total, and thus the most dangerous.

### PART 3: CALCULATING RISK

Begin by copying your top five (5) information assets from Table 2 and your top five (5) threats from Table 3 into Table 4.  

For each cell Threat and Asset estimate the likelihood of an attack from this threat on this asset, the impact of a successful attack, and then combine the two into a risk rating, using the following scales:

Likelihood:

Impact:

Finally, color code each cell based on the following Risk Rating:
