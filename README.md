# Risk management report

In this project, I will make data-driven decisions to devise plans and practices for use by organizational staff as well as be presented to a board-level audience. Detailed planning and risk management paper will be completed and as a presentation to the executive level. 

## Procedures

First, you will specify a risk management framework (RMF) to manage cybersecurity risk and describe the resources needed to support this RMF and prepare an executive briefing on that topic. 

Then, you will perform some of the initial steps in a risk management effort by identifying, classifying and prioritizing organizational assets and the threats to those assets. 

Finally, you will prepare and deliver a justification for the adoption of the risk management program.
